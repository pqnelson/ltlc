# Formally Verifying Lambda-Typed Lambda Calculus

This is a formal verification of de Groote's 位<sup>位</sup> type system,
as specified in his paper "Defining 位-Typed 位-Calculi by Axiomatizing
the Typing Relation".

Some highlights of the project:
- De Bruijn indices are used
- "Types" are lambda expressions
- There are no Pi types, only Lambda expressions and Lambda kinds
